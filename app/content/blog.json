		"description": "I recently read the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks paper and I'm fascinated by the idea of moving from fixed activations on the nodes of a MLP to learned ones at the edges. Combined with some other thoughts, I applied this idea to image classification and in this process came up with the idea of polynomial MLP's."
